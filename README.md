# Flask_Weather_App_Assignment

This weather web-app displays the weather of the coldest city among Tel-Aviv, Berlin and Budapest.
The app, built with Flask (Python), uses the OpenWeather Api to get a 5 days forecast for these cities.

**In order to use this app:**

(I used the terminal in VSCode on Windows10)

  1. Check your python version: `python --version` (my current version is Python 3.8.3)
  2. Install Flask: `pip3 install flask` (to build the API)
  3. Install requests: `pip install requests` (the get data from the API)
  
  
  In order to run the app: `flask run` on local server, and then nevigate to  http://localhost:5000/
