# Flask_Weather_App_Assignment

This weather web-app displays the weather of the coldest city among Tel-Aviv, Berlin, and Budapest. The app, built with Flask (Python), uses the OpenWeather API to get a 5-day forecast for these cities.

To use this app:

(I used the terminal in VSCode on Windows10)


  1. Check your python version: `python --version` (my current version is Python 3.8.3)
  2. Install Flask: `pip3 install flask` (to build the API)
  3. Install requests: `pip install requests` (the get data from the API)

To run the app: flask run on a local server, and then navigate to http://localhost:5000/


I also used Fontawesome just for fun :)
